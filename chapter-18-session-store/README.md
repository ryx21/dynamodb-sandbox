# Chapter 18: Building a Session Store

For this mini project, I'll be implementing the table design from Chapter 18.

1. Setup tables
2. Write some boundary code that implements the access patterns to the table
3. Write a simple CLI wrapper (which will act as the application code) that calls the boundary code
